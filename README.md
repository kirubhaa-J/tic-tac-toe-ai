#TIC-TAC-TOE

## Overview

- Python project where you play Tic-Tac-Toe against an **unbeatable AI**  
- The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to always make the best move  
- Helps understand **game theory**, **decision trees**, and **AI logic**  
- Simple and fun way to learn core concepts in Artificial Intelligence

## Features

-  Human vs AI gameplay  
-  AI powered by **Minimax Algorithm**  
-  Unbeatable logic (AI never loses)  
-  Clean and readable Python code  
-  Console-based interface  
-  Input validation and smooth user experience


##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x  
- Built-in modules only (like `math`)  
- No external libraries required  
- Recursion and decision-making using **Minimax Algorithm**

---

##  Applications

-  Ideal for mini-projects or academic submissions  
-  Helps beginners understand **search algorithms** & **game AI**  
-  Good example to discuss in interviews  
-  Great for practicing Python, logic-building, and recursion  
-  Learning tool for **problem-solving** and **turn-based game logic**
